# To-Do-Application
My very first project in React.

So, I've learnt in the past few weeks HTML5, CSS3 & JS, and I wanted to jump in something more challenging, and one thing I ran into was React JS, and yeah there was so many options obviously to start with better that a To Do Application, but hey I wanted to go simple and steady, and I did, it was so fun learning new stuff.

BTW, my next project's gon' be lit ðŸ”¥.
